# Data files - Add any large data files or sensitive files you don't want in the repo
# For example, if your CSVs or JSON datasets become very large:
# *.csv
# *.json
# (Be careful with this, you might want to commit small example datasets
# but not large raw data files. Your current knowledge_base_snippets.json is small
# and probably fine to commit, but simulated_crypto_insights_dataset.csv could grow large)
# qna_dataset_preparation/knowledge_base_snippets.json # Keep this if you want to version control your snippets
qna_dataset_preparation/rag_documents/ # These are generated, so usually not committed

# Sensitive credentials - ADC file should NEVER be committed
application_default_credentials.json
*.json # Be careful with this if you have other JSON files you DO want to commit.
       # It's better to be specific with credential file names.
