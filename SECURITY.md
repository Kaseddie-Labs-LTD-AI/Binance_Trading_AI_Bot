## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Binance Trading AI Bot seriously. We appreciate your efforts to
responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities you find.

Please report security vulnerabilities by using the **GitHub Security Advisories** feature.
You can initiate a private vulnerability report by going to the "Security" tab in our
GitHub repository and clicking "Advise against vulnerability".

If you are unable to use the GitHub Security Advisories feature, please contact us directly
at [kaseddie@gmail.com].

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an initial assessment. We will
keep you informed about the progress of the fix and will notify you when the vulnerability
has been resolved. Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had
a chance to address it.
