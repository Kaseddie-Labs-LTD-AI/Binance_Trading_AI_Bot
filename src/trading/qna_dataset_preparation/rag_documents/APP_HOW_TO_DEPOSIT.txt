Title: How to Deposit Funds into Your App Account
Keywords: deposit, add funds, fund account, transfer crypto, app deposit, how to send crypto

To deposit funds into your app account, first log in and navigate to the 'Wallet' or 'Funding' section. Select the 'Deposit' option. You will then need to choose the specific cryptocurrency you wish to deposit (e.g., BTC, ETH, USDT). The app will generate a unique deposit address for that cryptocurrency on the selected network (e.g., Bitcoin network, Ethereum ERC-20 network). **Crucially, ensure you select the correct network that matches the network of your sending wallet, as sending to the wrong network can result in permanent loss of funds.** For some cryptocurrencies (like XRP, XLM, EOS), a destination tag or memo may also be required; make sure to include this if provided. Carefully copy the deposit address (and memo/tag if applicable) and use it in your external wallet or exchange to initiate the transfer. Deposits typically require a certain number of network confirmations before the funds are credited to your app wallet; this time can vary depending on network congestion. Always double-check addresses and network selections before sending. This information is for guidance only.
