Title: Understanding Cryptocurrency Volatility
Keywords: volatility, price swings, risk, market fluctuations, crypto risk

Volatility in the context of cryptocurrency refers to the degree of variation of a trading price series over time. It is a measure of how much and how quickly the price of a cryptocurrency can change. High volatility means that an asset's price can change dramatically over a short time period, in either direction. Cryptocurrencies are generally known for being highly volatile compared to traditional financial assets like stocks or bonds. This high volatility can present opportunities for significant profit but also carries substantial risks of loss. It's very important for users to understand these risks and manage their investments accordingly. This information is for educational purposes and is not financial advice.
