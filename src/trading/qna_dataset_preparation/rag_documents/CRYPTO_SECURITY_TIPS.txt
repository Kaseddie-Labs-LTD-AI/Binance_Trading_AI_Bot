Protecting your cryptocurrency is crucial. Here are some basic security tips: 1. Use strong, unique passwords for all your exchange and wallet accounts, and enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) whenever possible, preferably using an authenticator app rather than SMS. 2. Be extremely wary of phishing scams: double-check website URLs, be suspicious of unsolicited emails or messages asking for your private keys or login details. Never share your private keys or seed phrases with anyone. 3. For significant amounts of crypto, consider using a hardware wallet (cold storage) which keeps your private keys offline and secure from online threats. 4. Keep your software (wallets, operating system, browser) updated to protect against known vulnerabilities. 5. Be cautious about public Wi-Fi when accessing your crypto accounts; consider using a VPN. 6. Understand that cryptocurrency transactions are generally irreversible. Always double-check addresses before sending funds. This information is for educational purposes and is not exhaustive security advice.
