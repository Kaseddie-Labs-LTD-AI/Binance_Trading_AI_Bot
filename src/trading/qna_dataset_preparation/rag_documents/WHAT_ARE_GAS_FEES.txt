Title: What are Gas Fees in Cryptocurrency?
Keywords: gas fees, transaction fees, ethereum gas, blockchain fees, gwei, network fees

Gas fees are transaction fees paid by users to compensate for the computing energy required to process and validate transactions on a blockchain, particularly on networks like Ethereum. 'Gas' refers to the unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute specific operations. The fee itself is typically paid in the native cryptocurrency of that blockchain (e.g., Ether for Ethereum). Gas prices can fluctuate based on network demand; higher demand usually leads to higher gas fees as users compete for their transactions to be included in the next block. Users can often set a gas limit (maximum gas they're willing to consume) and a gas price (price per unit of gas) for their transactions. This information is for educational purposes only.
