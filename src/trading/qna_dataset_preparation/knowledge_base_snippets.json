It operates on a peer-to-peer network, meaning transactions occur directly between users without an intermediary like a bank. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public, distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin is known for its limited supply, which is capped at 21 million coins, contributing to its potential as a store of value.

If the market price of that cryptocurrency drops to your stop price, the app will automatically attempt to place a market sell order to limit your potential losses. You can find the stop-loss option on the trading screen for each asset when placing a new order or for an existing open position. Please be aware that during periods of high market volatility, execution at the exact stop price is not guaranteed, and stop-loss orders may be subject to slippage. Using this feature is not financial advice, and you should understand the risks involved."

Each block typically contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. This design makes blockchains resistant to modification of their data because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks, which requires the consensus of the network majority. This technology is the foundation of most cryptocurrencies and ensures transparency and security."

It is a measure of how much and how quickly the price of a cryptocurrency can change. High volatility means that an asset's price can change dramatically over a short time period, in either direction. Cryptocurrencies are generally known for being highly volatile compared to traditional financial assets like stocks or bonds. This high volatility can present opportunities for significant profit but also carries substantial risks of loss. It's very important for users to understand these risks and manage their investments accordingly. This information is for educational purposes and is not financial advice."

It's a foundational technology for much of the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and NFT (Non-Fungible Token) space.

The app will generate a unique deposit address for that cryptocurrency on the selected network (e.g., Bitcoin network, Ethereum ERC-20 network). **Crucially, ensure you select the correct network that matches the network of your sending wallet, as sending to the wrong network can result in permanent loss of funds.** For some cryptocurrencies (like XRP, XLM, EOS), a destination tag or memo may also be required; make sure to include this if provided. Carefully copy the deposit address (and memo/tag if applicable) and use it in your external wallet or exchange to initiate the transfer. Deposits typically require a certain number of network confirmations before the funds are credited to your app wallet; this time can vary depending on network congestion. Always double-check addresses and network selections before sending. This information is for guidance only."

The RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Traditionally, the RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30. These levels can signal potential price reversals or pullbacks. However, RSI can also sustain overbought or oversold conditions for extended periods during strong trends. It's often used in conjunction with other indicators and analysis techniques.

The MACD line is typically calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD, called the 'signal line,' is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals. Traders may look for signal line crossovers, centerline crossovers, and divergences to generate signals. The MACD also has a histogram that shows the distance between the MACD line and the signal line. This information is for educational purposes and not financial advice."

They consist of a middle band being an N-period simple moving average (SMA), an upper band at K times an N-period standard deviation above the middle band, and a lower band at K times an N-period standard deviation below the middle band. Typically, N is set to 20 and K is set to 2. The bands widen when volatility increases and narrow when volatility decreases. Prices are considered high when they touch the upper band and low when they touch the lower band, but these are not direct trading signals on their own.

Use strong, unique passwords for all your exchange and wallet accounts, and enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) whenever possible, preferably using an authenticator app rather than SMS. 2. Be extremely wary of phishing scams: double-check website URLs, be suspicious of unsolicited emails or messages asking for your private keys or login details. Never share your private keys or seed phrases with anyone. 3. For significant amounts of crypto, consider using a hardware wallet (cold storage) which keeps your private keys offline and secure from online threats. 4. Keep your software (wallets, operating system, browser) updated to protect against known vulnerabilities. 5. Be cautious about public Wi-Fi when accessing your crypto accounts; consider using a VPN. 6. Understand that cryptocurrency transactions are generally irreversible. Always double-check addresses before sending funds. This information is for educational purposes and is not exhaustive security advice."

'Gas' refers to the unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute specific operations. The fee itself is typically paid in the native cryptocurrency of that blockchain (e.g., Ether for Ethereum). Gas prices can fluctuate based on network demand; higher demand usually leads to higher gas fees as users compete for their transactions to be included in the next block. Users can often set a gas limit (maximum gas they're willing to consume) and a gas price (price per unit of gas) for their transactions. This information is for educational purposes only."

Unlike market orders, which execute immediately at the best available current price, limit orders are not guaranteed to execute.
